I'm an amateur developer (emphasis on "amateur"), mainly interested in user experience.  I really enjoy the visual aspects of application development and try to make whatever I write as pleasant to look at as it is to use.

I'm mainly interested in writing/creating things that help make certain tasks easier, especially in the context of work, school, or the like.  For example, I'm looking at helping a local legal aid organization automate some of their casework.

I primarily use basic web front-end (HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript) due to portability and small file size.  I learn by doing, and do have ideas for a desktop app or two somewhere in the pipeline, so will end up finding a more "traditional" (i.e. offline) language before too long.  I personally do not like the weird web-desktop hybrids such as Electron.

Beyond coding, I'm interested in languages (both obscure and not, ancient and modern), writing systems (the more obscure the better), history, chemistry, and theology.  Sometimes I write small tools or apps to play with those things and/or to teach about them too.
